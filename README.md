# BillBoard - *Pay less together*

This is a 2nd year mobile development project for the University of applied sciences - Oulu. 

The idea of the app is to serve as an expense tracker for groups, where they can share their bills \
and keep track of the money flow between the group members. \
The business idea for the project is to serve as a real Billboard for our affiliate partners and \
advertise their products/services to our end-users. Users can find discount codes in the app.
